# Task Manager

## Description
This is a simple learning project for axum. It is a simple task manager that allows you to create, read, update and delete tasks. 
It follows the tutorial offered by [Jeremy Chone](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremyChone) on youtube and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZtlD_m59sM&t=52s).

Adding to the tutorial, I have restuctured the project to be more TDD friendly.
